[]== MAKEFILES ==[]
uses the "make" utility, tells it what to make.

Example:
[]===========================[]
 |  all: hello               |
 |  hello: hello.c           |
 |    gcc -o hello hello.c   |
 |                           |
 |  clean:                   |
 |    rm -f *.o hello        |
[]===========================[]


[]============ ESCAPE SEQUENCES ===============[]
\a "Alert character"   \\ "Backslash"
\b "Backspace"         \? "Question Mark"
\f "Formfeed"          \' "Single Quote"
\n "New Line"          \" "Double Quote"
\r "Carriage Return"   \ooo "Octal Number"
\t "Horizontal Tab"    \xhh "Hexadecimal Number"
\v "Vertical Tab"    **\0 "The end of a string"
=================================================
**\0 represents the end of a string, this will also mean that a String will
have one more character then what is visible.



Bitwise Operators

&  ->  Bitwise AND
|  ->  Bitwise OR
~  ->  Bitwise NOT
^  ->  Bitwise XOR
<< ->  Left Shift
>> ->  Right Shift

[Bitwise And]
5 & 2   101
        010  -> 000

5 && 2  -> True

[Swap without a temp using XOR]
x = x^y    But you shouldnt do this because:
y = x^y    1.) It's not readable 2.) If x and y are using the same location in memory
y = x^y

[Shifting]
46 << 2 = -72
0010 1110    << 2   1011 100

[Direction]

switch(data){
  case const1:
    stuff
    break;
  case const2:
    stuff
    break;
  case const3:
    stuff
    break;
  default:
    stuff
    break;
}



[Loops]
1: while when you dont know how many times to run
2: for when you know how many times you want to run
3: do-while when you want to run before checking the validity of the loop

[Error handling]
#include <errno.h>
Creates a integet called errno which has error codes
perror(""), prints when there is an error


[extern declaration]
if you want a global variable from another file needs to be defined with extern

static does not allow for other files to use the varaible


[Registers]
this shows the cimplier that this will be used a lot and it should be kept in a register
